## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

**All your work will happen inside *starter_code* so first enter *starter_code* and then run the command to create package.json file**.

**Your Website should have (at least) 3 pages:**

1. A home page
2. An "about" page
3. A photo gallery page

**Your site should also have a `public/` folder for:**

- CSS styling
- images
- (BONUS) some small front end JavaScript (click events, fade ins, popups, etc.)

Send your pull request before next class!


## Structure of Your Code

Your starter code only has an empty `app.js` file.
In addition to that, you will need:

1. a `package.json` file (run `npm init` to create one)
2. to npm install `express`
3. a `views/` folder for your separate HTML files
4. a `public/` folder for your publicly available files like CSS, images and (bonus) JavaScript


Happy coding! :heart:
